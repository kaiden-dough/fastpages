## Other People's Projects
- Ivy League Acceptance Calculator
    - A user would input information about themselves like:
        - Ethnicity
        - Gender
        - GPA
        - SAT score
        - ACT score
        - extracurriculars
    - Then the program would generate the acceptance probabilities to Ivy League Schools
