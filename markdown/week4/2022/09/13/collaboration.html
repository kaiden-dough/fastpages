  <li>
    <p>When Mr. Han visited Facebook he saw that there was a lot of open space and a beautiful seating area outside. These things all give opportunities to collaborate.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Effective collaboration produces a computing innovation that reflects the diversity of talents and perspectives of those who designed it. This means that collaborating brings new ideas to the program.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Super Mario Brothers 2 was a re-skinning of Super Mario Brothers 1. Kensuke Tanabe had a concept of where you got vertically in a level. Shigeru Miyamoto said to also add horizontal levels. Then they collaborated in Super Mario Brothers 3 and they combined both vertical and horizontal levels.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collaboration that includes diverse perspectives helps avoid bias in the development of computing innovations. This means when collaborating new features and ideas that wouldn’t be recognized alone are possible.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MC Question: B</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Takeaway: Collaboration has communication, consensus building, conflict resolution, negotiation. “If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together” - African Proverb</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Pair Programming: two programmers work together - the driver writes the code and the observer reviews the code and offers help</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Think-Pair-Share: think about a problem alone, talk about the problem with a problem, then share to a larger group</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Leaving comments in code: communicate to partners and to yourself, acknowledge code and media from other sources, specify what each person did, explain the code</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Collaborating in class: repl.it, GitHub, shared doc or folder, also ask others to test your program for feedback</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Takeaway: talk with the user to receive diverse ideas, find out ways to make the program more user friendly.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
