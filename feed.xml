For the College Board Performance Task, I need to make sure to complete all of the required parameters for a full score. My video must show the input, output, and the program functioning. The written response must include many things. It needs to describe the purpose, functionality, and inputs and outputs of the program. It need a list that stores data, and that list needs to be used somewhere else in the program. There also must be a list that manages complexity and describe how the list is important and how the program would function differently without it. The program needs a procedure with a parameter and an impact on the program, and it needs to be used in the program. The algorithm needs sequencing, selection, and iteration. The algorithm must be explained to rewrite it. Last, the written response needs to show tests on two arguments on a condition, and describe the results. Describe portion of Project you will use for Create Performance task The portion of the Project I will use for the Create Performance task is my calculator feature from the SAAKD Productivity Corp. (SPC) Describe code plan as it is required for CB, My code plan is to have function that would take the user’s expression and look for the signs in the expression. Then it would separate the expression into each specific number and operand. These would be stored in a list. Then another function would use the previous two lists to determine to add, subtract, multiply, and divide the numbers in the list, this will be iterated until all numbers and signs are used. This would give the result, which would be displayed on the screen. This is data abstraction because the list of the number and signs save space because it stores the data in a list instead of in individual variables. This is managing complexity because the data from the list would be iterated through quickly instead of a slower and more complex and inefficient method. Consider what will be demonstrated in video, aka video plan In the video I will show a recording of the calculator receiving input from the user. Then When the user presses the equals button, the program would display the answer to the expression inputted. Then I would show the an improper input being rejected and a previous entry being edited and recalculated. This would show input, program functionality, and output.]]></summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Multiple Choice Questions 2 Test Corrections</title><link href="https://kaiden-dough.github.io/fastpages/markdown/week20/2023/01/24/MCQ-2Correction.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Multiple Choice Questions 2 Test Corrections" /><published>2023-01-24T00:00:00-06:00</published><updated>2023-01-24T00:00:00-06:00</updated><id>https://kaiden-dough.github.io/fastpages/markdown/week20/2023/01/24/MCQ#2Correction</id><author><name>Kaiden Do</name></author><category term="markdown" /><category term="week20" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[My Grade]]></summary></entry></feed>
