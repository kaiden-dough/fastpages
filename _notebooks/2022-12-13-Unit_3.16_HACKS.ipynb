    "- An idea for a simulation is a coin flipping simulation to get data of how it lands. This is a simulation because the coin is not flipped in real life. The advantage is that more data can be found more efficiently. The disadvantage is that it might not have the the small change of landing on its side or different power in the coin flip and air resistance."

    "- What makes it a simulation?: This is a simulation because the program generates a random number from 1 to 6. It is also a simulation because the dice is not being rolled in real life but it is rolled in a program.\n",
    "- What are itâ€™s advantages and disadvantages?: The advantages of simulation are that it allows a lot of data of the dice results to be found in almost an instant. The disadvantage is that the dice would not experience the real life factors like air resistance, the power put into the roll, and friction.\n",
    "- In your opinion, would an experiment be better in this situation?: I think in this situation, a simulation is better because an experiment would take really long to get enough data.\n"
