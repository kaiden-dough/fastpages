<ul>
  <li>Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles:
    <ul>
      <li>Bits: the smallest unit of data in a computer, used to represent a boolean value</li>
      <li>Bytes: unit of data that is typically made up of 8 bits, used to represent a single character or symbol in a computer’s memory</li>
      <li>Hexadecimal: a numeral system that uses base 16, used in computing as a way to represent binary data in a more compact and human-readable form</li>
      <li>Nibbles: a unit of data that is made up of 4 bits, used to represent a single hexadecimal digit</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point:
    <ul>
      <li>Unsigned Integer: a positive whole number that can range from 0 to infinity that is determined by the number of bits used to represent the integer</li>
      <li>Signed Integer: can represent both positive and negative whole numbers</li>
      <li>Floating Point: a data type that represents a decimal number</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB:
    <ul>
      <li>Boolean: a data type that has only two possible values, true or false</li>
      <li>ASCII: a standardized character encoding that represents letters, numbers, and other symbols in computers; represent text in computers</li>
      <li>Unicode: a standardized character encoding that represents most of the world’s written languages; includes ASCII and many other characters from different scripts and languages</li>
      <li>RGB: a color model used to represent colors in devices; combination of these three colors in different proportions creates a wide range of colors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless:
    <ul>
      <li>Lossy: involves discarding some of the data in the original file in order to reduce its size; used for audio, video, and image files, where some loss of quality is acceptable in exchange for a smaller file size</li>
      <li>Lossless: involves encoding the data in such a way that all of the original information can be recovered when the file is decompressed; used for text, software, and other types of data where it is important to preserve all of the original information
