# Unit 3 Section 1-2
## Unit 3, Section 1.1: Data Types and Variables
 - Variable is an abstraction in a program that holds a value, only one value at a time
 - They have good names to organize code and understand what the variables represent
 - Some variables are booleans, numbers, lists and strings; each are used in different instances
 - Variables are seen as "containers" that have a name and value
 - Naming variables certain names are important to prevent confusion
 - Some variables are used for different things

## Unit 3, Section 1.2: Variables
 - Determine the value of variable as a result of an assignment, use assignment operator
 - In python, they use equal sign to assign a value to the variable
 - Recap: learn what is an assignment operator, how to use it, how to store value inside a variable

 ## Unit 3, Section 2.1 : List and Strings Using Variables
 - Strings are a series of characters, both numbers and letters and characters
 - Lists are sequences of elements with each element is a variable
    - In order
    - Can store different types of variables
    - Can be accessed by index (starts at 0)

## Unit 3, Section 2.2 : Data Abstraction with Lists
 - Lists bundle multiple variables under one name, can have different types of variables
 - User doesn't know how the list stores data so it is data abstraction

## Unit 3, Section 2.3 : Managing Complexity with lists
 - Use lists to manage complexity
 - Simplifies code and makes code faster and easier
    - Code is easier to read
 - Many variables are not needed, don't need to edit/add/remove entire variable to change it
