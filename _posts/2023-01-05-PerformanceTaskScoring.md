### Grade
|Student|Reporting Category|Student Score|College Board Score|Comments|
|-|-|-|-|-|
|1|Program Purpose and Function|1|0|I thought they got they point when they described their purpose, but that was just the functionality, which doesn't score the point.|
|1|Data Abstraction|1|1|Good job on this category|
|1|Managing Complexity|0|0|Did not meet neither of the two requirements. The example given did not manage complexity and it may have made the code a bit more confusing. Also the student didn't describe how the code would be written without the list.|
|1|Procedural Abstraction|1|1|Very good and very in depth description of the code segment for the ratio maker of the side lengths.|
|1|Algorithm Implementation|1|1|Full marks, did everything in the requirement for the category.|
|1|Testing|1|1|Also good, did everything that was in the requirement. Well done|
