## What Worked
I tried the remote theme, Merlot, on my website. 

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/merlot.png "Code Snippet")

For the most part many things still worked. The pages all opened and I could read basically everything on the page. My parallax effect still worked and the images also appeared.

## What Didn't Work
The things that didn't work were the small details: formatting, pictures, and my home screen.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/messedupformat.png "Website format was messed up")

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/hugepictures.png "The image sizing was changed")

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/messeduphs.png "The homepage did not work with the index.html heading")
