### Big Idea 5.5

1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in your personal blog.
   - The different license types in this Tech Talk are Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal, Open Source MIT License, and Open Source GPL License. The Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal license is doesn't allow copyrighting and it is given out for public use. The Open Source MIT License is when closed source can be distributed and the owner wants credit for the work. In the Open Source GPL License it allows the owner to do whatever to the project except distribute the the closed sources. 
2. In your blog, summarize the discussions and personal analysis on Software Licenses/Options, Digital Rights, and other Legal and Ethical thoughts from this College Board topic.

3. Make a license for your personal (blog) and Team repositories for the CPT project. Be sure to have a license for both Team GitHub repositories (frontend/backend). Document license(s) you picked and why. FYI, frontend, since it is built on GitHub pages may come with a license and restrictions. Document in blog how team made license choice and process of update.
