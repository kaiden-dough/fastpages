## Program Design and Development Video #1 Notes
- Program starts with an idea and a specific purpose
- They follow steps and stick to their plan to create their program
- Developers need to investigate the problem: what do we want to do, what are the constraints, what the user wants and needs
- They use surveys or interviews to investigate
- They brainstorm and storyboard the program
- Plan a user experience and UI
- They organize it and plan a testing method
- Developers decide requirements in program
- Then they make a prototype of the program and slowly refine the program
- Testing: testing in each small components and testing if the components work together also they receive user feedback
- Takeaway: Develop a program with development process and design a program and its user interface

## Program Design and Development Video #2 Notes
- Program development is not a solo act; there is a team of people
- Teams of individuals work on small parts of the whole program
- These people should be credited for what they do in the project
    - Can do this in the comments of the code
    - This helps in finding who can fix the bugs in the parts of the program
- When using code from outside resources, the people who programmed it should be credited by saying the author's name and the source
- MC Question: B
- Takeaway: Acknowledge code segments made collaboratively or from outside resources

## Program Design and Development Video #3 Notes
- Explain code segments with comments
- Program Documentation
    - describe overall program
    - list program specifications: functions and methods, specific code segments, lists of events, development of program, and authors
- Documentation happens at the beginning for specifications, during to keep track of process, after to explain the overall process
    - it can help with efficiency in programming process
    - programmers ability to test and refine program and fix bugs
- Comments do not affect the program, only helps the programmer collaborate or work individually
- Takeaway: Describe purpose of code segment through documentation, Program documentation is a description of a code segment, it is for programmers to read and doesn't affect the program, programmers should comment during development, it helps maintain programs when going solo or in a team, and some languages do not allow comments
