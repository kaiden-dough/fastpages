## Unit 1.2 Program Function and Purpose
The videos didn't fully prepare me for the questions and I had to put a little bit more time thinking about and answering these questions.

## Unit 1.3 Program Design and Development
From watching the videos, the MC questions were fairly straightforward to answer.

## Unit 1.4 Identifying and Correcting Errors
Question 3 Corrections: The number 7 results in the correct answer so it was incorrect because the answer wanted wrong results. But number 8 results in check minus instead of check so that was the correct answer.
