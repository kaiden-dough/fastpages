<ul>
  <li>Program starts with an idea and a specific purpose</li>
  <li>They follow steps and stick to their plan to create their program</li>
  <li>Developers need to investigate the problem: what do we want to do, what are the constraints, what the user wants and needs</li>
  <li>They use surveys or interviews to investigate</li>
  <li>They brainstorm and storyboard the program</li>
  <li>Plan a user experience and UI</li>
  <li>They organize it and plan a testing method</li>
  <li>Developers decide requirements in program</li>
  <li>Then they make a prototype of the program and slowly refine the program</li>
  <li>Testing: testing in each small components and testing if the components work together also they receive user feedback</li>
  <li>Takeaway: Develop a program with development process and design a program and its user interface</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Program development is not a solo act; there is a team of people</li>
  <li>Teams of individuals work on small parts of the whole program</li>
  <li>These people should be credited for what they do in the project
    <ul>
      <li>Can do this in the comments of the code</li>
      <li>This helps in finding who can fix the bugs in the parts of the program</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When using code from outside resources, the people who programmed it should be credited by saying the author’s name and the source</li>
  <li>MC Question: B</li>
  <li>Takeaway: Acknowledge code segments made collaboratively or from outside resources</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Explain code segments with comments</li>
  <li>Program Documentation
    <ul>
      <li>describe overall program</li>
      <li>list program specifications: functions and methods, specific code segments, lists of events, development of program, and authors</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Documentation happens at the beginning for specifications, during to keep track of process, after to explain the overall process
    <ul>
      <li>it can help with efficiency in programming process</li>
      <li>programmers ability to test and refine program and fix bugs</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Comments do not affect the program, only helps the programmer collaborate or work individually</li>
  <li>Takeaway: Describe purpose of code segment through documentation, Program documentation is a description of a code segment, it is for programmers to read and doesn’t affect the program, programmers should comment during development, it helps maintain programs when going solo or in a team, and some languages do not allow comments</li>
</ul>
