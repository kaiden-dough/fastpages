### My Grade

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/mcq#2.png)
I got a 49/50 on my test.

![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/q8wrong.png)
I got this question wrong because I just made an error. This is because I knew that the answer must have an equal number of returns and borrows, but I thought that if the product was equal, it meant the borrows and returns would be equal. But I was wrong and I got the question wrong, but I got the other choice correct.
