    - I got a 50/50 on the Tri 1 Final Exam on College Board.

## Questions I Found Difficult
- Question 18
    - ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/q18.png)
    - I didn't know what exactly the World Wide Web and Internet were
    - My answer was a lucky guess
- Question 19
    - ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/q19.png)
    - I did not know the binary values for the large numbers like 14 and 15 and 29
    - I had to google a binary converter in order to complete the question
- Question 22
    - ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/q22.png)
    - My binary skills are not that good so it took me a while converting the binary into decimal
    - But I still got the correct answer
- Question 24
    - ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/q24.png)
    - My binary is not good so it took some time doing question

## Conclusion
My understanding of the topics in the exam were all good except for the topics relating to binary and the internet and world wide web. I did not know the complex binary to decimal conversions. Also I did not know the explicit relationship between the world wide web and the internet.
