    "## My Quiz\n",
    "This quiz defines two functions for asking questions and receiving an answer. The quiz has 7 questions. Each question asked is compared to a correct answer and if they are equal (with no regard to case) then the quiz tells the user. If not, then the quiz tells the user that the answer is wrong. The program stores each correct answer and tells the user the percentage of correct answers at the end of the quiz."
