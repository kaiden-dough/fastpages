## Unit 2… Binary/Data Terms
- Bits, Bytes, Hexadecimal / Nibbles:
    - Bits: the smallest unit of data in a computer, used to represent a boolean value
    - Bytes: unit of data that is typically made up of 8 bits, used to represent a single character or symbol in a computer's memory
    - Hexadecimal: a numeral system that uses base 16, used in computing as a way to represent binary data in a more compact and human-readable form
    - Nibbles: a unit of data that is made up of 4 bits, used to represent a single hexadecimal digit
- Binary Numbers: Unsigned Integer, Signed Integer, Floating Point:
    - Unsigned Integer: a positive whole number that can range from 0 to infinity that is determined by the number of bits used to represent the integer
    - Signed Integer: can represent both positive and negative whole numbers
    - Floating Point: a data type that represents a decimal number
- Binary Data Abstractions: Boolean, ASCII, Unicode, RGB:
    - Boolean: a data type that has only two possible values, true or false
    - ASCII: a standardized character encoding that represents letters, numbers, and other symbols in computers; represent text in computers
    - Unicode: a standardized character encoding that represents most of the world's written languages; includes ASCII and many other characters from different scripts and languages
    - RGB: a color model used to represent colors in devices; combination of these three colors in different proportions creates a wide range of colors
- Data Compression: Lossy, Lossless:
    - Lossy: involves discarding some of the data in the original file in order to reduce its size; used for audio, video, and image files, where some loss of quality is acceptable in exchange for a smaller file size
    - Lossless: involves encoding the data in such a way that all of the original information can be recovered when the file is decompressed; used for text, software, and other types of data where it is important to preserve all of the original information
## Unit 3… Algorithm/Programming Terms
- Variables, Data Types, Assignment Operators:
    - Variables: used to store and manipulate data in a program
    ```python
    x = 10
    ```
    - Data Types: classification of data based on the type of value it can hold; include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and strings
    ```python
    x = 10
    y = "Hello"
    Nums = [1,3,4,6] 
    ```
    - Assignment Operators: a symbol that is used to assign a value to a variable (=)
- Managing Complexity with Variables:  Lists, 2D Lists, Dictionaries, Class:
    - Lists: an ordered collection of items with square brackets ([])
    ```python
    my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    mixed = [1, 'hello', 3.14, True]
    words = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
    ```
    - 2D Lists: also called a matrix, a list of lists
    ```python
    matrix = [[1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8], [9, 10, 11, 12]]
    ```
    - Dictionaries: collection of key-value pairs, uses curly braces ({})
    ```python
    dictionary = {'one': 1, 'two': 2, 'three': 3}
    ```
    - Class: a blueprint for creating objects, they have member variables and have behavior associated with them
- Algorithms, Sequence, Selection, Iteration:
    - Algorithms: a set of steps or instructions that are followed to solve a problem or perform a task
    - Sequences: executes a series of steps in a specific order
    ```python
    print(x)
    print(y)
    print("Hi")
    ```
    - Selection: executes one or more steps based on a specific condition
    ```python
    if x > 0:
        print("x is positive")
    elif x < 0:
        print("x is negative")
    else:
        print("x is 0")
    ```
    - Iteration: executes one or more steps repeatedly until a certain condition is met
    ```python
    x = 10
    while x > 0:
        print(x)
        x -= 1
    ```
- Expressions, Comparison Operators, Booleans Expressions and Selection, Booleans Expressions and Iteration, Truth Tables:
    - Expressions: combination of values, variables, and operators that results in a single value
    - Comparison Operators: compare values and determine if they are equal, greater than, or less than each other
        - "==": equal to
        - "!=": not equal to
        - ">": greater than
        - "<": less than
        - ">=": greater than or equal to
        - "<=": less than or equal to
    ```python
    x = 4
    y = 5
    print(x == y)
    print(x != y)
    print(x > y)
    print(x < y)
    print(x >= y)
    print(x <= y)
    ```
    - Boolean Expressions and Selection: a boolean variable (True/False) can be used as conditions in selection (if statements)
    - Boolean Expressions and Iteration: iteration (while loops) can use a boolean variable as a condition(if statements)
    - Truth Tables: A table for a logical operator containing each variable and all possible input and output results of that operator
        - AND: all inputs must return true
        - OR: one input must return true
        - XOR: only one input can be true
- Characters, Strings, Length, Concatenation, Upper, Lower, Traversing Strings:
    - Characters: a single letter, number, symbol, or other element
    - Strings: sequence of characters
    ```python
    name = "Kaiden"
    ```
    - Length: number of characters it contains
    ```python
    name = "Kaiden"
    print(len(name))
    ```
    - Concatenation: combining two or more strings into a single string
    ```python
    name = "Kaiden"
    lastName = "Do"
    concatenated = name + " " + lastName
    ```
    - Upper: convert a string to all uppercase
    ```python
    name = "Kaiden"
    print(name.upper())
    ```
    - Lower: convert a string to all lowercase
    ```python
    name = "Kaiden"
    print(name.lower())
    ```
    - Traversing Strings: to access each character in the string one by one, use a for loop to do this
    ```python
    name = "Kaiden"
    for x in name:
        print(x)
    ```
- Python If, Elif, Else conditionals; Nested Selection Statements:
    - Python If: execute a block of code if a specific condition is true
    ```python
    if x > 0:
        print("Hi")
    ```
    - Elif: to specify additional conditions to check if the previous conditions are false
    ```python
    if x > 0:
        print("Hi")
    elif x > -10:
        print("Bye")
    ```
    - Else conditionals: execute a block of code if all of the previous conditions are false
    ```python
    if x > 0:
        print("Hi")
    elif x > -10:
        print("Bye")
    else:
        print("NO NO NO")
    ```
    - Nested Selection Statements: control structures that contain other control structures within them
    ```python
    if x > 0:
        if b > 0:
            print("x and b are positive")
    ```
- Python For, While loops with Range, with List:
    - Python For: used to execute a block of code multiple times
    ```python
    for i in range(1, 6):
        print(i)
    ```
    - While loops with Range: execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met
    ```python
    x = 0
    while x <= 5:
        print(x)
        x += 1
    ```
    - with List: 
    ```python
    x = [4,3,5,2,1]
    i = 0
    while i <= len(x):
        print(x[i])
        i += 1
    ```
- Combining loops with conditionals to Break, Continue:
    - Combining loops with conditionals to Break: break is used to exit a loop early
    - Continue: used to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next one
    ```python
    while y > 0:
        if x == 0:
            break
        if x == 3:
            continue 
    ```
- Procedural Abstraction, Python Def procedures, Parameters, Return Values:
    - Procedural Abstraction: abstract away the details of how the task is performed, making your code easier to read and maintain, more efficient code
    - Python Def procedures: how procedures are made with the def word
    ```python
    def Greeting(name):
        print("Hello", name)
    Greeting("Kaiden")
    ```
    - Parameters: values that are passed to the procedure when it is called, defined within the parentheses of the procedure definition
    ```python
    def Sum(x,y):
        print(x+y)
    Sum(6,8)
    ```
    - Return Values: value that is returned can be used by the calling code to perform additional tasks or to assign to a variable
    ```python
    def subtract(x,y):
        diff = x - y
        return diff
    print(subtract(5,2))
    ```
